# Spaceship Titanic: A Kaggle Case Study

## Introduction
The Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle challenges participants to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the disaster. The dataset contains features about passengers, such as their demographics, travel details, and expenses, to build a predictive model. This case study documents the steps taken, models built, and insights gained during the competition.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of two main files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

### Train Dataset
- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **HomePlanet**: The planet the passenger is from.
- **CryoSleep**: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into cryosleep for the duration of the voyage.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number where the passenger is staying.
- **Destination**: The planet the passenger is traveling to.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **VIP**: Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
- **RoomService**, **FoodCourt**, **ShoppingMall**, **Spa**, **VRDeck**: Amounts the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanicâ€™s luxury amenities.
- **Name**: The first and last names of the passenger.
- **Transported**: Whether the passenger was transported to an alternate dimension. This is the target variable.

### Test Dataset
Similar to the train dataset, but without the `Transported` column.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps understand the data and uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships. Key steps in EDA include:

### Missing Values
- Identify and handle missing values in columns like `CryoSleep`, `Cabin`, `Age`, and `VIP`.

### Data Distribution
- Visualize the distribution of numerical features such as `Age` and expenses.
- Analyze the categorical features like `HomePlanet`, `Destination`, and `Cabin`.

### Correlation Analysis
- Examine the correlation between features and the target variable `Transported`.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves preparing the data for modeling. Key steps include:

### Handling Missing Values
- Impute missing values using strategies like mean/mode imputation or predictive modeling.

### Feature Engineering
- Extract useful information from the `Cabin` column (e.g., deck, room number).
- Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., total expenditure).

### Encoding Categorical Variables
- Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Data Normalization
- Scale numerical features to a common range for better model performance.

## Model Building
Several machine learning models were built and evaluated, including:

### Logistic Regression
A simple yet effective baseline model.

### Decision Tree
A model that splits data into branches to make predictions.

### Random Forest
An ensemble of decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

### Gradient Boosting
A powerful model that builds trees sequentially to optimize performance.

### Neural Networks
Deep learning models to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid search and random search were used to find the best hyperparameters for each model.

### Ensemble Methods
Combining the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy.

## Results
- The best model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation set.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that `CryoSleep`, `Cabin`, and `HomePlanet` were the most influential features.

## Conclusion
The Spaceship Titanic competition provided valuable insights into handling missing data, feature engineering, and model building. Future work could explore advanced techniques such as feature selection, deeper neural networks, and model stacking.
